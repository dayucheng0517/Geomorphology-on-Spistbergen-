# Geomorphology-on-Spistbergen-
Paper from Jack

## Intro 

### - Archipelago
1. West Spitsbergen (Vest-Spitsbergen)
2. North East Land (Nordaustlandet)
3. Edge Island (Edgeoya)
4. Barents Island (Barentsoya)
5. Charles Land (Prins Karls Forland)

### - Spistbergen
1. The name means “pointed mountains” (Tall mountain peaks)
2. The highest of these, Newtontoppen, located in the northern part of the island, reaches a height of 1,713 m a.s.l.

### - Polish research stations
1. The Kaffiøyra Polar Station in Oscar II Land, operated 
by Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

## General characteristics of Spitsbergen’s landforms

### - The physiographical characteristics of Spitsbergen
1. The geological structure of its tectonics
2. Climate
3. From the Precambrian to the Quaternary
4. Its primary geological units feature a meridional (經向的) arrangement
> Physiography : the study of physical features of the earth's surface
> The oldest known formations -- Hecla Hoek rocks
5. Mainly of metamorphosed (被變質的) crystalline rock, quartzite, marble and slate
6. Topography : Formidable (令人敬畏的) mountain ranges with sharp ridges and steep slopes

### - The central and eastern parts of the island
1. Rock from the Middle and Upper Paleozoic and 
Mesozoic eras
2. Occur horizontally or at a slight incline
3. They form extensive plateaus and mountain outliers, surrounded by vast valleys with steep slopes and extensive talus cones.

> Inliers and outliers
> + An inlier : an area of older rocks surrounded by younger rocks. Inliers are typically formed by the erosion of overlying younger rocks to reveal a limited exposure of the older underlying rocks.
> + An outlier : an area of younger rock surrounded by older rocks. An outlier is typically formed when sufficient erosion of surrounding rocks has taken place to sever the younger rock's original continuity with a larger mass of the same younger rocks nearby.
