# Geomorphology-on-Spistbergen-
Paper from Jack

## Intro 

### - Archipelago
1. West Spitsbergen (Vest-Spitsbergen)
2. North East Land (Nordaustlandet)
3. Edge Island (Edgeoya)
4. Barents Island (Barentsoya)
5. Charles Land (Prins Karls Forland)

### - Spistbergen
1. The name means “pointed mountains” (Tall mountain peaks)
2. The highest of these, Newtontoppen, located in the northern part of the island, reaches a height of 1,713 m a.s.l.

> Synopsis 概要
> Monograph 專刊

### - Polish research stations
1. The Kaffiøyra Polar Station in Oscar II Land, operated 
by Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń.

## General characteristics of Spitsbergen’s landforms

### - The physiographical characteristics of Spitsbergen
1. The geological structure of its tectonics
2. Climate
3. From the Precambrian to the Quaternary
4. Its primary geological units feature a meridional (經向的) arrangement
> Physiography : the study of physical features of the earth's surface
> The oldest known formations -- Hecla Hoek rocks
5. Mainly of metamorphosed (被變質的) crystalline rock, quartzite, marble and slate
6. Topography : Formidable (令人敬畏的) mountain ranges with sharp ridges and steep slopes

### - The central and eastern parts of the island
1. Rock from the Middle and Upper Paleozoic and 
Mesozoic eras
2. Occur horizontally or at a slight incline
3. They form extensive plateaus and mountain outliers, surrounded by vast valleys with steep slopes and extensive talus cones.

> Inliers and outliers
> + An inlier : an area of older rocks surrounded by younger rocks. Inliers are typically formed by the erosion of overlying younger rocks to reveal a limited exposure of the older underlying rocks.
> + An outlier : an area of younger rock surrounded by older rocks. An outlier is typically formed when sufficient erosion of surrounding rocks has taken place to sever the younger rock's original continuity with a larger mass of the same younger rocks nearby.
4. The overall system of mountain ranges and the fjords (Wijderfjorden and Woodfjorden) closely follows 
the meridian (子午線)

### - The western part of central and southern Spitsbergen
1. Marked by three fjords :  Isfjorden, Belsund and Hornsund
1. Indicate the path of old valley systems
2. Reformed by ice streams during subsequent glaciations in the Quaternary Period
3. Climatic fluctuations during the Late Glacial and the Holocene are responsible for its current sedimentation and the subaerial and subaqueous sculpting of their linear concave forms
> A dendritic system of Spitsbergen-type glaciers > Lower-order glaciers > Polyphase-generated forms
> Spitsbergen-type glaciers : It consists of large connected areas of ice and is divided up into a large number of rivers of ice and glacial fronts by mountain ridges and nunataks (冰原島峰) 

### - The northern part of the island
1. The most ice covered (eg. large ice-covered fjelds known 
as fonns)
2. Lomonosovfonna (Ny-Friesland), Holtedahlfonna (Haakon VII Land), and the largest, covering all of Olav V Land.

### - The central-eastern part of the island
1. Less ice covered
2. The Nordmannsfonna ice cap (Sabine Land)

### - The southern part of Spitsbergen
1. The Sørkappfonna ice cap

> All the ice caps and major valley glaciers, feature individual or chains of nunataks, which have undergone intense weathering processes, generating intense detrital (碎屑) cover.

### - Termination of the glacier
> + Glaciers on the east coast
>   1. Terminate on ice cliffs on the Barents Sea (Strongbreen, Inglefieldbreen)
>
> + Glaciers on the west coast
>   1. Terminate at the Greenland Sea, though much less often on cliffs (Vestre Torellbreen, Olsokbreen)
>   2. End far from the open sea in fjords (Nordenskiöldbreen, Mittag-Lefflerbreen, Paulabreen, 
Hornbreen)
>   3. Terminating on land feature the terminal moraines, as well as marginal and extra-marginal sandurs (沖刷平原) of varying degrees of development

### - The snow line
1. On the eastern and south-eastern parts ca. 200 m a.s.l.
2. In the central and western parts as high as ca. 800 m a.s.l.
> The glacier retreat has been ongoing since the latter half of the 19th century, i.e., since the end of the Little Ice Age
> At the beginning of the early Middle Ages the level of glaciation on Spitsbergen, especially in the South, was much smaller than today

### - Several glacier-free large valleys on Spitsbergen
1. In the central and southern part of the island
2. Sassendalen, Adventdalen, Reindalen, Colesdalen, Dickdalen and Dunderdalen

### - The coastline of Spitsbergen (especially on the western coast)
1. A series of well-defined marine terraces
> Abrasion shelves : covered with 
pebbles reach up to ca. 4 km in width and ranging from 100 to >300 m
> Low terraces (even those 10 m a.s.l) can be find whale bone fragments and drift wood

### - ***The fate of Quaternary phenomena in Spitsbergen***
1. The highest marine boulder and fragments of weathered 
marine-type pebbles were found in the upper reaches of 
Hohenloefjelet
2. These landforms associated with the actions of the sea provide a good illustration of the complex glacio-isotatic and eustatic (全球性海面升降的) processes that occurred on Spitsbergen during the Pleistocene

> Eloquent 不容質疑的
3. The presence of fragments of marine pebbles has been reported in the supraglacial debris cover in the marginal sections of the Cambridgebreen
4. Tidal pebbles inside Spitsbergen’s fjords (Petuniabukta or Nottinghambukta)
5. Skerries in the littoral zone of the rocky coast
